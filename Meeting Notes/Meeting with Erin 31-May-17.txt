Meeting Notes

- Do not focus just on microexpressions

- Look for simple, obvious things at first
	- Talking/no
	- Smiling/not
	- Laughing/not

- Noteable cam1par1001 - straight face

- Concerns about glasses and other obstructions

- Check isTracked for parsing data files

- 'streamclip' for viewing frame number

- Lab file format:
pid	cam	Min	Sec	Frame	smile	talking

- Consider audio for machine learning

- Roadmap
	- Simple labelling
	- Initial deep learning on simple labels and tracking and possibly other data, e.g. audio, video, etc.
	- DL model which corresponds a behaviour to data
		- Can train on any behaviour
		- Will be able to label new data with behaviour
