Summer Research Plan

Goals:

	1. Acquire labelled data set
	2. Design ML model for conversations
		- Sentiment analysis: classifies emotionality (e.g. through confidences)
		- Prediction: predict future behaviours and interactions between conversation partners
	3. Test and improve ML model
	4. Write up results

Input Stucture:

	At each timestamp we have various feature vectors, providing a feature matrix at one timestamp which forms a 3D tensor across time

	- Video (avi files)
		- Each pixel has a feature vector of RGB, depth, infrared
			- Can scale up images with have lower resolutions (e.g. infrared image)
	- Processed face and body data (fsq and txt file)
		- See "Berkel Pro Face Data Outline.txt"
	- Sound
		- Includes directional information

Data Labelling:

	Can use existing software (Eyeris by Emovu, others)

Proposed Models:

	Alpha Model
		1. Procecessing layers - Feed forward convolution layers for image processing
		2. Recurrent layers - Reccurent layers to compare to previous data
		3. Resolution layers - Layers outputting label confidences for classification

	Beta Model
		A more general architecture backed by a standard ML model.

Planned Timeline:

	May
		- Generate labelled data
		- Acquire some unlabelled data for future labelling and as testing data
		- Fill in design details of model
		* Data visualization
	June
		- Begin implementation of model
		- Early testing and iteration
		- Continue generating labelled data
	July
		- Finish first complete version of model
		- Design and develop other model versions
		- Testing and iteration of all versions
		- Continue generating labelled data as needed
	August
		- Iterate across versions with minor improvements, aiming to increase accuracy with model
		- Run tests with new data, evaluate accuracy of all model versions and compare
		- Write up results

Discussion:

	- Resources
		- Kinect SDK 2.0 (API and documentation)
		- Matlab Kinect Documentation
		- Microsoft (and other orgs and research) write ups

	- Plot kinematic data

	- Try naive model
